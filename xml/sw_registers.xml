<registers name="Virtual Core Debug Registers" prefix="VIRT_">
    A virtual register is one that doesn't exist directly in the hardware, but
    that the debugger exposes as if it does. Debug software should implement
    them, but hardware can skip this section. Virtual registers exist to give
    users access to functionality that's not part of standard debuggers without
    requiring them to carefully modify debug registers while the debugger is
    also accessing those same registers.

     <register name="Privilege Mode" short="priv" address="virtual">
        Users can read this register to inspect the privilege mode that
        the hart was running in when the hart halted.
        Users can write this register to change the privilege mode that
        the hart will run in when it resumes.

        This register contains {dcsr-prv} and {dcsr-v} from {csr-dcsr}, but in a place that the user
        is expected to access. The user should not access {csr-dcsr} directly,
        because doing so might interfere with the debugger.
